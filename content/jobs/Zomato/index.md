- Increased completion of critical sales tasks by 35% by shipping a real-time push notification platform (Go + Kafka); designed idempotent consumers, retry/backoff, and rules-based routing so the right teams acted on the right events fast.  
- Cut invoice processing cost 10x and cycle time 50% by building an automated extraction & attribution pipeline on in-house LLM services; unified ingestion → parsing → validation → posting → approval, with confidence thresholds, fallbacks, and finance audit logs.  
- Built a ledger accrual and vendor payout system with SFTP based Bank integrations (using Go, Kafka, DynamoDB, Redis) to automate disbursements for 10K+ vendors daily, saving nearly 20 hours of man-power weekly and reducing errors in payouts.  
- Improved reliability and security across a microservices stack by optimizing high-latency APIs (profiling + hot-path rewrites) and remediating critical vulnerabilities; introduced safer defaults (authn/z, secret handling) and CI checks (linting, SAST/DAST) to harden production.
